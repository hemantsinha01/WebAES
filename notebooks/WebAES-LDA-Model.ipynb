Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to act by feeding them data so that they can learn a few tricks on their own, without being explicitly programmed to do so. Neural Networks are a set of algorithms and techniques, modelled in accordance with the human brain. Neural Networks are designed to solve complex and advanced machine learning problems. Robotics is a subset of AI, which includes different branches and application of robots. These Robots are artificial agents acting in a real-world environment. An AI Robot works by manipulating the objects in its surrounding, by perceiving, moving and taking relevant actions. An expert system is a computer system that mimics the decision-making ability of a human. It is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to simulate the judgment and behaviour of a human or an organization that has expert knowledge and experience in a particular field. Fuzzy logic is an approach to computing based on “degrees of truth” rather than the usual “true or false” (1 or 0) Boolean logic on which the modern computer is based. Fuzzy logic Systems can take imprecise, distorted, noisy input information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the Artificial Intelligence method that analyses natural human language to derive useful insights in order to solve problems.'\n",
