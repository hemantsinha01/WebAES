                        <p style='padding-right: 20px; text-align: justify;'>SAE (Subjective Answer Evaluation) is an AI expert system that enables the automatic evaluation of online subjective tests.
                            <br><br>Using a smart word embedding based algorithm, SAE evaluates the answer responses submitted by students and awards appropriate marks based on the answer expected by the faculty for the same question.
                            <br><br>Faculties can create questions with the expected answer and create tests using these questions. Students can take available tests and submit their answers to SAE. SAE then evaluates the submitted answers and gives back the results in minutes.
                            <br><br>This helps in saving a lot of time and effort for faculties in evaluating assessments by automating the entire process of answer evaluation. SAE saves time and effort while maintaining reliability in answer evaluation for online assessments.
